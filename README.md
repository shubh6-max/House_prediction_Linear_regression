# House prediction (Linear regression)

# Supervised Linear Regression (House price prediction on kaggle)
# Problem Statement:
Both buyers and sellers are interested in housing price ranges. Create a regression model that can accurately estimate the price of a house based on its features.
# Outcome:
Build a model using Linear Regression, Lasso, Ridge, and SelectFromModel. So, Lasso with SelectFromModel is the best performing model, with 0.2544 RMSE and 0.8912 adjusted R-squared.
# Key skills: 
Data cleaning, Exploratory data analysis, Feature engineering, Scaling, Encoding, Linear regression, Feature selection, model selection.
